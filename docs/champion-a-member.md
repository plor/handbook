Raid Guild grows organically, adding new members as individual existing members deem appropriate and champion them in. Our championing process relies both on the Champion being a good judge of who is a good fit for the Guild as well as on the Championâ€™s reputation within the Guild being at stake.

In addition to reputation, to ensure that we are only bringing the highests quality new members, Champions must also put down $RAID as a semi-financial stake.

We also recognize that Championing involves a degree of mentorship. To encourage and compensate Champions for their mentorship of new members, Champions of successful new members will receive a $RAID reward in addition to receiving back their original stake.

### $RAID Staking 

To champion a new member, a Champion must stake $RAID. The stake amount depends on the type of applicant:
* If the applicant has finished one of the Raid Guild Cohorts, the required stake is `25,000 $RAID`
    * Exception: if the Champion is from the same cohort season as the applicant, the required stake is the same as for non-cohort applicants.
* If not, the required stake is `50,000 $RAID`

The Champion will receive their stake back if the apprentice meets the [success criteria](./champion-a-member#Success-Criteria) outlined below.

Upon staking the applicant shall receive the Apprentice status, which the guild
is responsible for ensuring has the necessary permissions to meet the
[success criteria](./champion-a-member#Success-Criteria) outlined below.

### $RAID Reward

Champions receive a reward of `25,000 RAID` if their new member meets [success criteria](./champion-a-member#Success-Criteria) outlined below.

### Success Criteria

New members are successful when they contribute to the Raid Guild community, bring in value to the Guild, and earn income for themselves.

After 60 days of Apprenticeship, the applicant may be considered for membership
if they have acheived the following criteria:

1. Successfully join at least 1 [raid](./join-a-raid) or [RIP](./rips). This include raids or RIPs still in progress (provided the member is in good standing on that project).
2. Attend at least 2 [Guild meetings](./community-meetings), including Roundtable and Raider Rally.
3. Demonstrate shared values with the Guild (at the discretion of the DAO).

### Championing Process
Follow these steps to Champion in a new member:

1. Stake the appropriate amount of $RAID by transferring the $RAID to the `New Member Championing` minion at this address: `0x45b49f854eebadbdb59ede30fe5b37ba56a0f26c`.
2. Create an issue on the [RIP repository](https://github.com/raid-guild/RIPs)
   using the `Championship` issue type. Track further progress on the [Champion
   Board](https://github.com/raid-guild/RIPs/projects/3).
3. Include the blockscout transaction url as well as other information about the applicant in this issue.
4. Help the new member get onboarded and engaged in Guild activities.
5. Record the applicant's activity related to the new member [success criteria](./champion-a-member#Success-Criteria).
6. Have the applicant submit a membership proposal to the DAO and include 
   information on the [success criteria](./champion-a-member#Success-Criteria) in the proposal description.
   This is how the Guild will validate their success.
7. If/once the applicant has met the new member [success criteria](./champion-a-member#Success-Criteria), 
   make a proposal requesting your original stake plus your reward from the `New Member Championing` minion. 
   Your proposal should include a link to the member proposal to show success from Apprentice to Member.
